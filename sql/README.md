Table
1. Foregink

Logics
1. AND always evaluates before OR
2. LIKE and REGEX are used in the same position
3. HAVING does not allow name alias after it
4. IN is used for comparing multiple rows; = is used for comparing 1 row
5. ALL can be used to compare the return values of subquieries iteratively in an ‚ÄúAND‚Äù pattern. e.g.: price > ALL (SELECT ‚Ä¶) <==> price > ALL (100, 105, 99 ‚Ä¶.)
6. ANY can be used to compare the return values of subquieries iteratively in an ‚ÄúOR‚Äù pattern. e.g.: price > ANY (SELECT ‚Ä¶) <==> price > ANY (100, 105, 99 ‚Ä¶.)
7. correlated query: A query consists of 1 main query and 1 sub query, and the subquery uses fields of main query as it‚Äôs own query-conditions.
8. EXIST results in a correlated subquery. It can be used to replace IN if the subquery has a strictly larger search space. than the main query.
9. AGGREGATE functions and ordinary rows can not be selected in the same SELECT clause 
10. Views can
    1. Simplify queries by using already computed results
    2. Reduce impact of changes
    3. restrict access to underlying table
11. triggers: a block of SQL code that automatically gets excuted before or after an insert, update or delete statement
12. procedures: store, organize secure and optimize (internally) SQL commands outside project sourcecode
13. events: event: block of SQL code gets executed according to a schedule (first need to turn it on)

C Syntax
1. insert a row:  INSERT <table_name> (<col_name1>, <col_name2>) VALUES (<val1>, <val2>);
2. create a table copy: CREATE TABLE <new_table_name> AS SELECT * FROM <old_table> WHERE ...

R Syntax
1. select a schema: USE <schema_name>
2. order of SQL in one statement: SELECT <col_name> FROM <table_name> WHERE ‚Ä¶ ORDER BY‚Ä¶
3. % any number of characters (%y);; _ single character(___y);; 
4. REGEXP: 
    1. ‚Äòxxx‚Äô: any record that ‚Äòxxx‚Äô is a substring
    2. ^: begin with, ‚Äò^a‚Äô
    3. $: end with, ‚Äòabc$‚Äô
    4. |: or, ‚Äòfiled | mac‚Äô
    5. [gim]e: ge & ie & me
    6. [a-e]e: equivalent to [abcde]e
5. LIMIT: <offset>, <number of records>
6. JOIN:
    1. INNER JOIN: select multiple tables based on a column <col_name>, return all rows that share the same <col_name> value in all those tables (no null)
    2. SELF JOIN: inner join a table with itself on a column <col_name>, return all rows that share the same <col_name> value in all those tables (no null)
    3. LEFT OUTER JOIN:
        1. if <table1> joins <table2> on <col_name>, which is a <table1> non-null fk and a <table2> pk. Then LEFT OUTER JOIN <table1> to <table2> is equivalent to INNER JOIN of them 
        2. if <table1> joins <table2> on <col_name>, which is a <table1> nullable fk and a <table2> pk. Then LEFT OUTER JOIN <table1> to <table2> keep all rows of <table1>, including nulls
    4. RIGTH OUTER JOIN: use LEFT OUTER JOIN instead in practice

U Syntax
1. update single/ multiple row(s): UPDATE <table_name> SET <col_name1> = <val1>, <col_name2> = <val2> WHERE <col_name> = XXX;
2. update with subqueries (example):  UPDATE orders o SET o.comments = 'Gold Customer' WHERE o.customer_id IN (
    SELECT c.customer_id
    FROM customers c
    WHERE c.points > 3000
);

D_Syntax
1. delete single/ multiple row(s): DELETE FROM invoices WHERE client_id = (
    SELECT *
    FROM clients
    WHERE name = 'Myworks'
);

7. DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL +/-1 YEAR)
8. DATEDIFF(NOW(), DATE_ADD(NOW(), INTERVAL 1 YEAR)), return differences in days

Index (quickly find data by grouping similar data together, but it increases db size and slows write operations)
* Create prefix index: CREATE INDEX <idx_col_name> ON <table_name> (<col_name>(<length>));
1. To reduce the number of rows to search, we need to experiment on <length> with <col_name>‚Äôs cardinality, which is number of unique values in the column of <col_name>. The higher the cardinality, the more efficient the index is:
CREATE INDEX idx_lastname ON customers (last_name(5)); ‚¨áÔ∏è
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT LEFT(last_name, 1)) AS unique_char FROM customers ; ‚ùé
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT LEFT(last_name, 5)) AS unique_char FROM customers; ‚úÖ
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT LEFT(last_name, 9)) AS unique_char FROM customers; ‚ùé

* Full text indexes (build search engines for text)
1. Example code:
CREATE FULLTEXT INDEX <idx_col_1_col_2> ON posts (<col_1>, <col_2>);
SELECT title body FROM posts 
WHERE MATCH(title, body) AGAINST('react redux');
#WHERE MATCH(title, body) AGAINST('react -redux' IN BOOLEAN MODE);

* Composite indexes (indexes using multiple columns, max is 16, used mostly in reality)
1. Index does not work with expressions on indexed col:
CREATE INDEX idx_points ON customers (points);
EXPLAIN SELECT  customer_id FROM customers WHERE points + 10 > 2010; # bad
EXPLAIN SELECT customer_id FROM customers WHERE points > 2000; # good
2. Indexes' orders are important:
If we do CREATE INDEX idx_state_points ON customers (state, points);
Then CREATE INDEX idx_state ON customers (state) is redundant;
But CREATE INDEX idx_points_state (points, state) and CREATE INDEX idx_points (points) are not redundant;
3. We need to USUALLY construct indexes based on the order of most commonly used query-columns with high cardinalities ; And query those columns in SELECT and ORDER BY clauses.
4. Indexes we defined always contain the indexed columns plus primary key. CREATE INDEX idx_state_points ON customers (state, points) ==> id, state, points are indexed

* IndexSort (use index to sort data by "Using index", which is much better than "fileSort"
1. Example: for idx_<col_1>_<col_2>, the following sorts will be fast (not use fileSort)
‚Ä¶ SORT BY col_1
‚Ä¶ SORT BY col_1, col_2
‚Ä¶ SORT BY col_1 DESC, col_2 DESC
.. WHERE col_1 = 'XX' ORDER BY col_2
.. WHERE col_1 = 'XX' ORDER BY col_2 DESC

Transacation
* Transaction process:
1. scan transaction see if locks apply 
2. process transaction and put locks on operated rows until transaction ends
* ACID Properties:
1. Atomicity: either all statements in tranasaction success and the transaction is commited, or 1 statement fails and all changes are rollback
2. Consistancy: the db remains consistant during the transaction
3. Isolation: if multiple transactions want to modify the same row, the row is locked and only 1 transaction can modify it at a time
4. Durability: change made by transaction is permanent once it‚Äôs commited

* Concurrency Problems
1. Two Concurrent Updates (if 1 transaction is updating a row, it puts a lock on the row and prevent other transactions modifying the row until first transaction commits or rollback):
2. Lost updates problem (later commits overrides earlier commits if lock is not on. That‚Äôs why MySQL puts lock on by default)
3. Non-repeating problem (Transaction A reads <row_1>, before it‚Äôs next read on <row_1>, transaction B is completed and updated <row_1>. So transaction A reads 2 values of <row_1>; isolation levels)
    1. Solved by Repeatable read: If transaction A is repeatable and it selects same rows 2 times. Before the 2nd select, if another transaction modified the rows, transaction A will ignore those changes and the 2 select returns rows with the same values. 
4. Dirty read problem (A transaction reads a undone data; isolation levels)
    1. Solved by Read committed: Transaction A updates a record and before it commits, transaction B selects the uncommited record. Add read commited isolation to transaction B forces the it to select the record after any transactions happening on that record are done.
5. Phantom read (Transaction A selecting some rows which are updated and commited by other transactions before transaction A commits. Transaction A will not see those changes; isolation levels)
    1. Solved by Serializable: If a serializable transaction A is about to selecting some rows. But Tranasaction B is currently updating the rows. Transaction A will wait transaction B to complete, then select the rows to make sure updated rows being selected.
6. Dead lock (Both transactions hold a lock on a row that others need)
    1. Example (T1 started first, after T1 finished update <row_1>, T2 started): 
		T1: update <row_1>‚úÖ ; update <row2>          T2: update <row_2> ; update <row_1>     
‚Äî>          T1: update <row_1>‚úÖ ; update <row2>          T2: update <row_2>‚úÖ ; update <row_1>
‚Äî>          T1: update <row_1>‚úÖ ; update <row2>üîÑ     T2: update <row_2>‚úÖ ; update <row_1>
‚Äî>           T1: update <row_1>‚úÖ ; update <row2>üîÑ     T2: update <row_2>‚úÖ ; update <row_1>üîÑ          ‚Äî> Error 1213 DeadLock!
